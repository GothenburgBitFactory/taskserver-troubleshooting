        <h2>Sync Problems</h2>
        <p>
          Here is a list of problems you may encounter, with the most common ones listed first.
        </p>
        <p>
          The single most common problem has been that the Taskserver Setup Instructions were not properly followed.
          Please review the steps you took.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Versions</h2>
        <p>
          It is always a good idea to make sure that you are using the latest release of Taskwarrior and Taskserver, not just because bugs are fixed that may help you, but also because the solutions below are geared toward the current releases.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you upgrade from an older release of Taskserver, you will need to follow the <a href="http://taskwarrior.org/docs/taskserver/upgrade.html">upgrade instructions</a>.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>'task sync' showed task list</h2>
        <p>
          You have a version of Taskwarrior older than <code>2.3.0</code>, which means there was no <code>sync</code> command, and you are seeing a list filtered by the search term 'sync'.
          Upgrading is the only solution.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Taskwarrior without GnuTLS</h2>
        <p>
          You are using version <code>2.3.0</code> or later, but the Taskwarrior binary was compiled without <a href="http://www.gnutls.org">GnuTLS</a> support.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you installed Taskwarrior using your OS's package manager, you may be suffering from an out of date package.
          Prod your OS's package maintainer for an update.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>GnuTLS and recent releases</h2>
        <p>
          Recent releases make GnuTLS support opt-out instead of opt-in, so upgrading to the latest version may help.
          Otherwise, you will need to build Taskwarrior from the <a href="http://taskwarrior.org/download/task-latest.tar.gz">latest source tarball</a>, following the instructions in the <code>INSTALL</code> file.
          If you are a developer, do that.
          If you are not, then installing a development environment is probably not something
          you want to do, in which case contact your OS's package maintainer.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Verify GnuTLS support</h2>
        <p>
          Verify that your Taskwarrior was built with GnuTLS support by running <code>task diagnostics</code>:
        </p>
        <pre><code data-trim class="bash">
        $ task diagnostics | grep libgnutls
        libgnutls: 3.3.18
        </code></pre>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>nodename nor servname provided</h2>
        <p>
          This means the Taskwarrior setting <code>taskd.server=&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</code> refers to a host name that cannot be seen by Taskwarrior.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Is it spelled correctly?</li>
          <li>Is the domain correct?</li>
          <li>Is there a valid DNS resolution for the name?</li>
          <li>Is there a firewall between Taskwarrior and Taskserver that is not letting through <code>&lt;port&gt;</code> traffic?</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Could not connect</h2>
        <p>
          Taskserver may not be running on <code>&lt;host&gt;</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Check with <code>ps -leaf | grep taskd</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes the error message is misleading, please check "Handshake failed" as well.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Unable to use port</h2>
        <p>
          By default, port <code>53589</code> is used, but whichever you chose must be open on the server.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are unable to open firewall ports, you can use an SSH Tunnel to route port <code>53589</code> traffic over port <code>22</code>:
        </p>
        <pre><code data-trim class="bash">
        $ ssh -L localport:dsthost:dstport user@example.com
        </code></pre>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Handshake failed</h2>
        <p>
          There are many reasons that the TLS handshake can fail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please do the following on your client:
        </p>
        <pre><code data-trim class="bash">
        $ openssl s_client -CAfile .task/ca.cert.pem -host HOST -port PORT
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          The result should be something like <code>Verify return code: 0 (ok)</code>.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Handshake errors</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Certificate fails validation, Handshake failed</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Could not connect to &lt;host&gt; &lt;port&gt;</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When you generated certificates, you modified a <code>vars</code> file, in particular the <code>CN=&lt;name&gt;</code> setting.
          That name must match the output of <code> hostname -f</code> on the server for the certificate to validate.
        </p>
        <pre><code data-trim class="bash">
        $ certtool -i &lt; server.cert.pem | grep Subject:

        $ openssl x509 -noout -in server.cert.pem -subject
        </code></pre>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Naming</h2>
        <p>
          Additionally, that name must also be used in the <code>taskd.server=&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</code> setting for Taskwarrior.
          Otherwise you'll need <code>taskd.trust=ignore hostname</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are using a self-signed certificate, did you specify it using the <code>taskd.ca</code> setting?
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Ciphers</h2>
        <p>
          Setting <code>taskd.ciphers</code> can force the use of different ciphers.
          Use <code>gnutls-cli --list</code> to see a list of installed ciphers, and confirm that there is overlap between client and server.
          There needs to be a cipher that is available to both, otherwise they cannot communicate.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Certificate still valid?</h2>
        <p>
          Certificates have expiration dates, and if you followed our instructions, you created a certificate that is valid for one year.
          Check your certificate with this command:
        </p>
        <pre><code data-trim class="bash">
        $ certtool -i --infile ~/.task/&lt;YOUR NAME&gt;.cert.pem
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          If your certificate has expired, you need a new one.
          You may also need to regenerate expired server certificates.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Note on validation dates</h2>
        <p>
          Note that creating certificates that never expire is a bad idea.
          Certificates may be compromised.
          A certificate that is considered secure today, may not be considered secure in a year.
          Is the key length you chose something that will remain suitable in the future? Will the algorithms you chose remain secure?
          For these reasons, choose an expiration date that lets you reevaluate your choices in the relatively near future.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Note on GnuTLS security</h2>
        <p>
          As a <a href="http://gnutls.org/security.html">security product</a>, it is imperative that you keep your GnuTLS up to date.
        </p>
        <p>
          As with many security products, GnuTLS is maintained by a responsible and quick-responding team that takes security very seriously.
          Benefit from their diligence by keeping your GnuTLS up to date.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>GnuTLS outdated?</h2>
        <p>
          We have received reports of issues with older GnuTLS releases.
          Specifically, version 2.12.20 has problems validating certificates under certain conditions.
          Newer releases have addressed memory leaks that were able to take down Taskserver.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please keep in mind that you have to recompile Taskserver completely to benefit from the new version.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Recompile Taskserver</h2>
        <p>
          Upgrading GnuTLS does nothing to upgrade taskd -- it has to be rebuilt from scratch, which means:
        </p>
        <pre><code data-trim class="bash">
        $ cd taskd.git
        $ rm CMakeCache.txt
        $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release .
        $ make
        $ sudo make install
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          This can then be verified using <code>taskd diagnostics</code>.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Ancestor not found</h2>
        <p>
          You skipped the important step of running:
        </p>
        <pre><code data-trim class="bash">
        $ task sync init
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          This performs an initial upload of your tasks, and sets up a local sync key, which identifies the last sync transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note that older Taskwarrior versions (before 2.5.1) only sync the <strong>pending</strong> tasks and not all tasks.
        </p>

        <h2>Debugging</h2>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Hostname and IP address</h2>
        <p>
          There is a difference between <em>hostname</em> and <em>IP address</em>, honestly.
          We are referencing the hostname throughout the documentation because you need a valid hostname for the certificate and working name resolution for the client to connect to the server.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>So please use the hostname where you are advised to do it!</strong>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Diagnostics</h2>
        <p>
          You may wish to try and debug the problem yourself.
          You will probably not.
          But if you do, here is how.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both Taskwarrior and Taskserver have a <code>diagnostics</code> command, the purpose of which is to show you relevant troubleshooting details.
          Additionally it will indicate problems directly, for example, it will tell you if your cert/key files are not readable.
          The output from <code>diagnostics</code> is intended to be included in bug reports, and doing so saves you a lot of time, because it's the first thing we'll ask for.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>task diagnostics</h2>
        <pre><code data-trim class="bash">
        $ task diagnostics
        ...
        $ taskd diagnostics
        ...
        </code></pre>
        Read the output of the <code>diagnostics</code> commands carefully, there may be several types of problems mentioned, which need to be addressed before going further.
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Taskserver Debug Mode</h2>
        <p>
          The next step would be to run the server in debug mode.
          First shutdown your Taskserver, then launch it interactively:
        </p>
        <pre><code data-trim class="bash">
        $ taskdctl stop
        ...
        $ taskd server
        ...
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          You can hit <code>Ctrl-C</code> to stop this server.
          For highly verbose output, try this:
        </p>
        <pre><code data-trim class="bash">
        $ taskd server --debug --debug.tls=2
        ...
        </code></pre>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Taskwarrior Debug Mode</h2>
        <p>
          Similarly, Taskwarrior has a verbose debug mode, and debug TLS mode:
        </p>
        <pre><code data-trim class="bash">
        $ task rc.debug=1 rc.debug.tls=2 sync
        ...
        </code></pre>

        <h2>Getting Help</h2>
        <p>
          As a last resort, ask for help.
          But please make sure you have carefully reviewed your setup, and gone through the checks above before asking.
          No one wants to lead you through the steps above to discover that you didn't.
        </p>
        <p>
          We'll ask you to provide the <code>diagnostics</code> output for both Taskwarrior and Taskserver, then we're going to go through the steps above, because this is our checklist also.
